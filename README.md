# jupyter_dynare

A JupyterLab extension for Dynare's `.mod` files using [Dyno.py](https://github.com/EconForge/dyno.py).

## Instructions

After installing [pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/), you can simply use the command `pixi run lab` in the project's directory to install all dependencies and run a jupyter lab instance. You can then simply upload and open a `.mod` file to see the extension in action.
